    //In Ethereum, the contract always uses the fallback function by default to respond to transfers. In general, most contracts use send-statements or transfer-statements to send ethers, both of which carry only 2300 gas. When the fallback function of the contract consumes more than 2300 gas, the transfer will fail. In exceptional circumstances, this will render the external contract dysfunctional and the contract unable to receive transfers.
